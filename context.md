# Project Context: Bhumija Holidays Website (MVP)

## Overview
Build a complete production-grade MVP website for **Bhumija Holidays**, a Nepal-based cultural travel handling company serving tourists visiting Kathmandu and Janakpurdham. The brand identity is premium, cultural, modern, globally professional, and warm.  

All **textual content that is not explicitly provided** must be **generated by Claude** as polished, production-ready copy.

## Primary Goals
- Present Bhumija Holidays as a premium cultural travel provider.
- Showcase travel packages (dummy packages should be fully generated by Claude).
- Highlight Janakpurdham and Mithila culture.
- Capture leads via a quote form (email routing only).
- All content should be fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

## Autogeneration Rules for Claude
Claude must generate:

### 1. **All missing page copy**
- About page content (story, mission, values)
- Destination descriptions for Kathmandu & Janakpurdham
- Testimonials (3–5 dummy reviews)
- FAQs (8–10 questions)
- Homepage text blocks (Why Bhumija, How It Works, spotlight text)
- Footer contact placeholder copy (until real info is provided)

### 2. **Dummy travel packages**
Claude must generate at least **3 complete packages**, each with:
- Title  
- Duration  
- Starting price (realistic for Nepal)  
- Short summary  
- Highlights  
- Day-by-day itinerary  
- Inclusions & exclusions  
- Gallery placeholder names  
(The structure must be consistent so devs can replace later.)

### 3. **Legal pages**
Claude must generate professional placeholder text for:
- Terms & Conditions  
- Privacy Policy  
- Cancellation Policy  

These should be long-form, realistic, and safe for production until real legal text replaces them.

### 4. **Contact placeholders**
Claude must generate:
- Placeholder admin email  
- Placeholder phone  
- Generic address location (e.g., Kathmandu office)

### 5. **Form copy**
Claude must generate:
- Input labels  
- Placeholder text  
- Validation messages  
- Success page text  
- Auto-reply email content

## Technical Architecture
- Framework: Next.js (latest) with TypeScript
- Styling: TailwindCSS
- Hosting: Vercel
- Forms: Next.js API → Email (SendGrid or Formspree)
- Content storage: JSON/TS/MDX files inside `/data`
- No database needed for MVP
- Fully responsive design

## Branding
### Colors
- Indigo 900: #0B3D91  
- Saffron 600: #FF8C00  
- Gold 500: #D4AF37  
- Charcoal 900: #2B2B2B  
- Off White: #FAF7F0  

### Typography
- Headings: Playfair Display  
- Body: Inter  

### Tone Guidelines for Autogenerated Content
- Warm Nepali hospitality + premium global travelers focus
- Clear, minimal, visually clean wording
- Culturally rich when describing Janakpur & Mithila

## Pages (MVP)
Claude must build and populate the following pages with autogenerated content:
- Home
- About
- Destinations → Kathmandu / Janakpurdham
- Packages (with autogenerated dummy packages)
- Package Detail (autogenerated)
- Plan My Trip (quote form)
- FAQ
- Reviews/testimonials (autogenerated)
- Policies (Terms, Privacy, Cancellation)
- Contact

## Future scalability (architect for future)
- Additional destinations
- Online payment integration
- Partner dashboard portals
- CMS migration (Sanity, Strapi, Payload)

This context fully defines what the project is and instructs Claude Code to generate all missing textual content.
