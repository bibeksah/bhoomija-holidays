        "Nepal's capital is a living museum where every corner reveals another layer of history. From the medieval splendor of Durbar Squares to the spiritual sanctuaries of Pashupatinath and Boudhanath, Kathmandu offers an unparalleled journey through South Asian civilization.",
      description: `Kathmandu Valley is where Nepal's soul resides. For over two millennia, this remarkable valley has been a crossroads of culture, trade, and spirituality—a place where Hindu and Buddhist traditions interweave seamlessly, where kings built palaces as offerings to the gods, and where artisans perfected crafts that continue to astonish the world.

The valley holds seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites within its compact geography. Kathmandu Durbar Square, with its intricate woodcarvings and the palace of the living goddess Kumari. Patan, the city of artists, where metalwork and stone carving reached heights unmatched elsewhere. Bhaktapur, frozen in time, offering a glimpse of medieval Nepal. The great stupas of Swayambhunath and Boudhanath, white domes watching over the valley like wise guardians. And Pashupatinath, one of Hinduism's most sacred sites, where the cycle of life and death plays out eternally on the banks of the Bagmati.

But Kathmandu is more than its monuments. It's the narrow alleys of Asan market, fragrant with spices. It's the morning prayers echoing across Boudhanath. It's the taste of momos in a hidden courtyard. It's conversations with monks, artists, and shopkeepers who share their stories freely. This is the Kathmandu we want to show you—not just its stones, but its soul.`,

        "The sacred birthplace of Goddess Sita and the living heart of Mithila culture. A pilgrimage destination of profound spiritual significance and a vibrant center of traditional art and heritage.",
      description: `Janakpurdham is Nepal's spiritual secret—a city where mythology breathes in the present. Here, in what was once the ancient kingdom of Mithila, Goddess Sita was born from the earth, was raised by King Janak, and married Lord Ram in a ceremony that echoes through the ages. For millions of devotees, this is among the holiest grounds on earth.

But Janakpurdham offers more than religious significance. It's the living heart of Mithila culture, a tradition stretching back thousands of years with its own language, cuisine, music, and most famously, its extraordinary art. Mithila painting, once adorning the mud walls of village homes, has gained UNESCO recognition and global appreciation. Here, you can meet the women artists preserving this tradition, learn its symbols and stories, and understand why every line and dot carries meaning.

The city's centerpiece is Janaki Mandir, one of Nepal's largest and most beautiful temples, a marvel of Rajput architecture rising in white splendor. Beyond it lie sacred ponds from Ramayana legends, smaller temples marking specific events in Sita's life, and the Vivah Mandap where her divine marriage is commemorated.

Unlike the well-trodden paths of Kathmandu, Janakpurdham offers authentic pilgrimage culture relatively untouched by mass tourism. Here you join genuine devotees, share in their practices, and experience spirituality as it has been lived for millennia. For those seeking more than scenic beauty—for those seeking meaning—Janakpurdham delivers profoundly.`,

    question: "What is the best time to visit Nepal for cultural tours?",
    answer:
      "Nepal's cultural sites are accessible year-round, but the best seasons are autumn (September-November) and spring (March-May). Autumn offers clear skies, comfortable temperatures, and coincides with major festivals like Dashain and Tihar. Spring brings beautiful weather and vibrant rhododendron blooms. Winter (December-February) is cooler but less crowded, while monsoon (June-August) has occasional rain but lush landscapes and fewer tourists.",
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    question: "Do I need a visa to visit Nepal?",
    answer:
      "Most nationalities can obtain a visa on arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport or land border crossings. You'll need a passport valid for at least 6 months, passport-sized photos, and the visa fee (USD 30 for 15 days, USD 50 for 30 days, USD 125 for 90 days). Indian nationals don't require a visa. We recommend checking current requirements before travel as policies can change.",
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    question: "How physically demanding are your cultural tours?",
    answer:
      "Our cultural tours are designed for travelers of all fitness levels. While there is walking involved—through temple complexes, old city streets, and heritage sites—the pace is relaxed with plenty of rest stops. Most sites are accessible, though some temples have steep stairs. Please let us know of any mobility concerns, and we'll adjust your itinerary accordingly.",
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    question: "What should I pack for a cultural tour in Nepal?",
    answer:
      "Comfortable walking shoes are essential. Pack modest clothing for temple visits (shoulders and knees covered), layers for varying temperatures, and a light rain jacket. Sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat are useful. We recommend bringing a power adapter (Nepal uses Types C, D, and M), a camera, and any personal medications. A small daypack is handy for daily excursions.",
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    question: "Are your tours suitable for vegetarians or those with dietary restrictions?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Nepal has a rich vegetarian culinary tradition, and our team is experienced in accommodating dietary requirements including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and specific allergies. Please inform us of your needs when booking, and we'll ensure appropriate arrangements at all meals and cooking classes.",

Simply use our 'Plan My Trip' form to share your preferences, and our team will design a journey tailored to you.",
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    question: "What is included in the package prices?",
    answer:
      "Each package listing details specific inclusions, but typically our prices cover accommodation, specified meals, transportation within Nepal, English-speaking guides, entrance fees, and activities mentioned. International flights, visa fees, travel insurance, personal expenses, and gratuities are generally not included. We provide complete transparency before booking.",

  {
    id: "8",
    question: "How do I get to Janakpurdham?",
    answer:
      "Janakpurdham is accessible by both air and road. Buddha Air operates regular flights from Kathmandu to Janakpur Airport (approximately 25 minutes). Alternatively, the scenic drive from Kathmandu takes about 8-9 hours through Nepal's diverse landscapes—many travelers prefer this option to experience the journey. We handle all transportation logistics as part of your package.",
  },
  {
    id: "9",
    question: "Is it safe to travel to Nepal?",
    answer:
      "Nepal is generally very safe for tourists. The Nepali people are renowned for their hospitality, and tourist areas are well-traveled. As with any destination, we recommend standard precautions: be aware of your surroundings, secure valuables, and have travel insurance. Our team provides 24/7 support during your journey and keeps current on local conditions.",
  },
  {
    id: "10",
    question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
    answer:
      "We understand plans can change. Cancellations made 30+ days before departure receive a full refund minus processing fees. Cancellations 15-29 days before receive 50% refund. Cancellations within 14 days are non-refundable but may be applied to future travel within one year. We strongly recommend travel insurance. See our full cancellation policy for details.",
